# Fraud Delivery Executive Identification using Isolation Forest

This project aims to detect fraudulent delivery executives using the Isolation Forest algorithm. It analyzes data features like undelivered order rates, delivery times, and session data to identify anomalies indicative of fraud. The repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model implementation with Isolation Forest, and evaluation metrics. This project enhances delivery service integrity by improving fraud detection capabilities.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering for anomaly detection
- Isolation Forest model implementation
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
