# Fraud Delivery Executive Identification using Isolation Forest

This project aims to detect fraudulent delivery executives using the Isolation Forest algorithm. It analyzes data features like undelivered order rates, delivery times, and session data to identify anomalies indicative of fraud. The repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model implementation with Isolation Forest, and evaluation metrics. This project enhances delivery service integrity by improving fraud detection capabilities.

### Dataset Description: Swiggy/Zomato Order Information

The **Swiggy/Zomato Order Information** dataset, created by Bhavik Chandna, is a comprehensive collection of data pertaining to food delivery orders managed by riders. Each order is uniquely identified by an `order_id`, and key timestamps such as `order_time`, `allot_time`, `accept_time`, `pickup_time`, `delivered_time`, and `cancelled_time` provide insights into the order lifecycle. The dataset also tracks whether an order was cancelled (`cancelled`) and if it was reassigned to another rider (`reassigned_order`).
